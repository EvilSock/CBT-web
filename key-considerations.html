		<h3 class="h3" > Why should I consider cognitive behaviour therapy?</h3>
		<p class="p"> CBT is practical, goal orientated and based on objective, measurable concepts that have been verified scientifically (empirically). For instance, behaviour can be observed, measured and studied, as can thought, which we are typically able to articulate through language. Scientific investigation 
			has shown that our thoughts are associated with our emotional states and behavioural reactions and that observing, accepting and changing of our 
			thoughts typically impacts on the way we feel. Well designed, peer-reviewed research papers (over 1000) have demonstrated that CBT is effective 
			in the treatment of psychological problems and psychiatric disorders. CBT is effective in the treatment of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, interpersonal problems, eating disorders, substance-related problems, psychotic disorders, impulse control disorders, insomnia and behavioural problems. Treatment is often based on a specific treatment protocol, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for specific psychological problems.</p>
		<h3 class="h3"> What happens during cognitive behaviour therapy?</h3>
		<p class="p">Cognitive behaviour therapy sessions are structured and time-limited. A supportive, compassionate, and collaborative relationships with our clients is central to effective treatment. As CBT targets specific goals defined collaboratively around management of emotion and behavioural outcomes one has to work during your treatment sessions and also needs to be prepared to practice certain tasks in between sessions. We help people 
			understand their problem, develop a conceptualisation of their problem, plan specific interventions and discuss implementation of these interventions </p>
		<h3 class="h3"> How many sessions do I need?</h3>
		<p class="p">This varies according to the type of problem you are experiencing. A straight-forward problem can only need a few (6-8) sessions. When problems 
			are multi-faceted and have been around for longer you might benefit from a longer period of treatment. Sessions are typically weekly in the beginning and the frequency of sessions would then in collaboration with yourself be gradually tapered.</p>
		<h3 class="h3 ">Do you accept medical aid? </h3>
		<p class="p">We do submit claims to your medical aid on your behalf, you will however be responsible to confirm with your medical aid that psychotherapy is 
			covered on your plan and that you have funds available. You will remain primarily responsible for payment for services. </p>
