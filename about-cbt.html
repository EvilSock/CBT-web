				<h1 class="h1" id="about">ABOUT COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOUR THERAPY</h1>
				<h2 class="h2" id="CBT">WHAT IS CBT?</h2>
				<p class="p">The idea that our thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs have a profound influence on the way we feel and react to what life throws at us has been around for 
					centuries; since the early Greek philosophers. The scientific discipline of psychology has however only recently given attention to this phenomenon 
					as a means of understanding and treating psychological problems. While the initial psychological theory of human emotion and behaviour (originally 
					based on the work of Sigmund Freud), certainly made significant contributions toward the development of the profession, few theoretical frameworks 
					have had as significant an impact on the treatment of psychological distress as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). The primary difference between 
					CBT and other psychotherapy models is based on the notion that emotional and behavioural disturbance is essentially driven by the way in which we 
					think about that with which we are confronted. The fictitious scenario below provides an example of the type of thinking that would typically be associated with depressed mood.
				</p>
				<p class="p cl-m-green" style="margin-left: -1vw; margin-right: -1vw; padding-left: 1vw; padding-right: 1vw;padding-top:1vh;padding-bottom: 1vh; font-style: italic;">
						Example: Joe fails his economics exam and thinks "I am such a failure; I'll never manage to get through this degree; the rest of my life is ruined". As 
						a result Joe (1) feels depressed, (2) withdraws himself, (3) renders himself helpless and his situation hopeless and (4) drops out prematurely from his 
						studies.<br>
						Alternatively, if Joe was able to think in a more helpful and realistic manner and consider the following thoughts such as, "oh well, I failed, but then 
						who hasn't? This is a real inconvenience, but is it really a catastrophe? I could certainly learn from my mistakes and try again; this isn't the only thing 
						I can study or do with my life", then he'd be more likely to (1) feel sad or disappointed but not feel depressed, (2) not withdraw himself or (3) not give 
						up prematurely.<br>
						His disappointment would be considered healthy and may actually help motivate him to try harder next time. This fictitious account provides for a 
						typical example of how our emotional and behavioural reactions to difficult circumstances are determined to a large degree by the way in which we 
						think about our circumstances, and not merely by those circumstances themselves. In other words, Joe's emotional and behavioural reaction is determined by how he thinks about the fact that he failed, and not solely his failure.
				</p>
				<p class="p" style="padding-bottom: 3vh;">
					CBT theory proposes that if we are able to identify those thinking and behavioural patterns that are contributing toward our distress, restructure and 
					alter these, then one would be better equipped to reduce or eliminate psychological distress. The CBT model thus encourages "emotional responsibility" by encouraging individuals to identify and alter the way in which they think so as to feel and react in a more appropriate way. This also provides 
					for a more optimistic view regarding the potential for human beings to alter their emotional and behavioural reactions to difficult circumstances. The 
					model proposes that individuals can effectively and successfully influence their own emotional well-being, irrespective of the situation with which 
					they are confronted.<br>
					CBT is practical, goal orientated and based on objective, measurable concepts that have been verified scientifically (empirically). For instance, behaviour can be observed, measured and studied, as can thought, which we are typically able to articulate through language. Scientific investigation 
					has shown that our thoughts are very much associated with our emotional states and behavioural reactions and that restructuring of our thoughts typically alters the way we feel. Thousands of well designed, peer-reviewed research papers have verified the central tenets of CBT. CBT-based intervention is based on what we now know works regarding the treatment of a wide variety of psychological disorders. There is ample scientific evidence 
					that CBT is effective in the treatment of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, interpersonal problems, eating disorders, substance-related problems, psychotic disorders, impulse control disorders, insomnia and behavioural problems. Treatment is often based on a specific protocol, with brief, direct, 
					and time-limited treatments for specific psychological disorders

				<h2 class="h2" id="anger">ANGER</h2>
				<h3 class="h3">DEFINING ANGER</h3>
				<p class="p">
					The most common costs of anger are the destruction it causes to personal relationships. We make ourselves angry at the ones we love more often than 
					being angry with other people. <br><br>
					A lot of frustration arises in the workplace, we have deadlines to meet, difficult bosses, problems with staff, unfairness, and all these things can test 
					your patience. Your anger about frustrations can frustrate you more. Getting along with work colleagues is important to be able to succeed in the 
					workplace. Anger can effect these relationships negatively. <br><br>
					"Anger is a subjectively experienced emotional state with high sympathetic automatic arousal. It is initially elicited by a perception of a threat (to 
					one's physical well-being, property, present or future recourses, self-image, social status or projected image to one's group, maintenance of social 
					rules that regulate daily life, or comfort), although it may persist even after the threat has passed. Anger is associated with attributional, informational, 
					and evaluative cognitions that emphasise the misdeeds of others and motivate a response of antagonism to thwart, drive of, retaliate against, or attack 
					the source of the perceived threat. Anger is communicated through facial or postural gestures or vocal inflections, aversive verbalizations, and aggressive behaviour. One's choice of strategies to communicate anger varies with social roles, learning history, and environmental contingies."- DiGuiseppe & Tafrate in a 2007 publication (Understanding anger disorders) propose the following definition for anger
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">Constructs associated with Anger</h3>
				<p class="p">
					When understanding anger it is important to define constructs that are used to describe anger, aggression, hostility, hate and irritability. DiGuiseppe 
					& Tafrate provides working definitions for these constructs.
				</p>
				<p class="p"><b>Anger</b> is defined above.</p>
				<p class="p"><b>Aggression</b> is defined as overt motor behaviour enacted with the intent to do harm or injury to a person or object, with the expectation that harm will occur</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b>Hostility</b> refers to a semi permanent set of attitudes that can be either general or situational in nature. Such attitudes are related to both affective and 
					behavioural characteristics.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b>Hate</b> refers to an enduring negative affect of antagonism with a strong desire to effect revenge or hurt an opponent, without the physiological arousal 
					normally associated with anger. Hate can turn to anger if the person actually confronts the object of his or her hate.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b> Irritability </b>is defined as a complex construct that involves increased sensitivity to environmental stimulation that causes physiological arousal and 
					tension, without cognitive mediation, and that results in a lowered threshold to experience anger, and/or impulsive, but not premeditated, aggression.
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">Linking Anger to Depression and Anxiety</h3>
				<p class="p">
					A belief exists in psychology that anger is closely associated with depression and anxiety. Recent research suggests that anger is an emotion separate 
					from negative affectivity. Anxiety and depression are probably more closely related to each other than to anger
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">ANGER AND AGGRESSION</h3>
				<p class="p">
					To treat anger properly it is important to distinguish between anger and aggression. Anger can lead to aggression, but aggression is not anger.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					Others (court, spouse, employer) often refer people who experience difficulty with managing anger and aggression to psychotherapy. During psychotherapy, clients are quickly able to control their aggression, but continue to experience anger. It is a misconception that all people displaying aggression are actually angry. Studies show that some spouses showing aggression does not display physiological arousal associated with anger when they 
					assault their victims, they rather show the response that predatory animals do when they stalking their prey (Jacobson & Gottman(1998)).
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					It is thus important for treatment purposes to distinguish between anger and aggression.
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">
					Considering anger as a mediator of violence
				</h3>
				<p class="p"> 
					Instrumental aggression is not having anger present and lacking an intention to harm others. The motive of instrumental aggression is to coerce others 
					into giving recources to the aggressor.
				</p>
				<p class="p"> 
					Affective aggression (also called hostile or reactive aggression, or rage) is defined as having anger present, being motivated by causing harm to 
					others, and is characterised by a cognitive style of impulsivity or lack of planning.
				</p>
				<p class="p"> 
					Research shows that the dichotomy of Instrumental vs. Affective aggression does not account for people who are for example suicide bombers. To 
					commit such an act they have to experience intense anger/hate but they do not act impulsively. It would be safer to say that multiple variations drive 
					aggression.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<br><b>Murder and anger </b><br> 
					Murder can be seen as a form of disturbed behaviour as murderers rarely achieve their desired ends, and they usually regret their actions and it usually 
					leads to harm for the perpetrator. Pincus (2001) uncovered three variables common to most murderers. Most of them suffered from some neurological 
					dysfunction that resulted in impaired impulse control. They suffered from some psychiatric disorder such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Diso`rder, or Schizoaffective Disorder. Lastly, the perpetrator experienced severe abuse during childhood. It seems that long-term, intense resentment about being 
					abused and shamed, and an inability to control impulses is key variables that may lead to anger in and an angry and aggressive episode.
					<br>The murder victim may not be the person who caused the most pain, but could rather be the last one in a long list of people who are perceived to have 
					insulted the murderer.<br><br>
					<b>Rape, Sexual Assault, and Anger</b><br> 
					Anger may motivate rape. Sex offenders have frequently suffered harsh treatment, neglect and rejection at the hands of family members and others. 
					Rapists may therefore be particularly sensitive to perceived rejection, leading to shame and anger. Sexual offending may be a behaviour pattern that 
					is used to restore a sense of worth and perceived control.<br><br>
					<b>Domestic violence and Anger</b><br>
					Anger may play a significant role in domestic violence. Spousal abuse is a rampant problem word wide. Studies in the USA suggest that 12-18% of 
					all murders are spousal assaults. Forty percent of woman murdered each year die at the hands of their husbands (Sigler, 1989). Research suggests that 
					not all perpetrators of partner violence are alike. <br>
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">
					Diagnosing Anger as a disorder
				</h3>
				<p class="p">
					DiGiuseppe and Tafrate (Understanding anger disorders,2007) suggest a new diagnosis in an attempt to describe anger that is disordered. Their proposed Anger Regulation-Expression Disorder (ARED) is as follows.

					Diagnostic Criteria for Anger Regulation-Expression Disorder
