				<h1 class="h1" id="about">ABOUT COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOUR THERAPY</h1>
				<h2 class="h2" id="CBT">WHAT IS CBT?</h2>
				<p class="p">The idea that our thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs have a profound influence on the way we feel and react to what life throws at us has been around for 
					centuries; since the early Greek philosophers. The scientific discipline of psychology has however only recently given attention to this phenomenon 
					as a means of understanding and treating psychological problems. While the initial psychological theory of human emotion and behaviour (originally 
					based on the work of Sigmund Freud), certainly made significant contributions toward the development of the profession, few theoretical frameworks 
					have had as significant an impact on the treatment of psychological distress as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). The primary difference between 
					CBT and other psychotherapy models is based on the notion that emotional and behavioural disturbance is essentially driven by the way in which we 
					think about that with which we are confronted. The fictitious scenario below provides an example of the type of thinking that would typically be associated with depressed mood.
				</p>
				<p class="p cl-m-green" style="margin-left: -1vw; margin-right: -1vw; padding-left: 1vw; padding-right: 1vw;padding-top:1vh;padding-bottom: 1vh; font-style: italic;">
						Example: Joe fails his economics exam and thinks "I am such a failure; I'll never manage to get through this degree; the rest of my life is ruined". As 
						a result Joe (1) feels depressed, (2) withdraws himself, (3) renders himself helpless and his situation hopeless and (4) drops out prematurely from his 
						studies.<br>
						Alternatively, if Joe was able to think in a more helpful and realistic manner and consider the following thoughts such as, "oh well, I failed, but then 
						who hasn't? This is a real inconvenience, but is it really a catastrophe? I could certainly learn from my mistakes and try again; this isn't the only thing 
						I can study or do with my life", then he'd be more likely to (1) feel sad or disappointed but not feel depressed, (2) not withdraw himself or (3) not give 
						up prematurely.<br>
						His disappointment would be considered healthy and may actually help motivate him to try harder next time. This fictitious account provides for a 
						typical example of how our emotional and behavioural reactions to difficult circumstances are determined to a large degree by the way in which we 
						think about our circumstances, and not merely by those circumstances themselves. In other words, Joe's emotional and behavioural reaction is determined by how he thinks about the fact that he failed, and not solely his failure.
				</p>
				<p class="p" style="padding-bottom: 3vh;">
					CBT theory proposes that if we are able to identify those thinking and behavioural patterns that are contributing toward our distress, restructure and 
					alter these, then one would be better equipped to reduce or eliminate psychological distress. The CBT model thus encourages "emotional responsibility" by encouraging individuals to identify and alter the way in which they think so as to feel and react in a more appropriate way. This also provides 
					for a more optimistic view regarding the potential for human beings to alter their emotional and behavioural reactions to difficult circumstances. The 
					model proposes that individuals can effectively and successfully influence their own emotional well-being, irrespective of the situation with which 
					they are confronted.<br>
					CBT is practical, goal orientated and based on objective, measurable concepts that have been verified scientifically (empirically). For instance, behaviour can be observed, measured and studied, as can thought, which we are typically able to articulate through language. Scientific investigation 
					has shown that our thoughts are very much associated with our emotional states and behavioural reactions and that restructuring of our thoughts typically alters the way we feel. Thousands of well designed, peer-reviewed research papers have verified the central tenets of CBT. CBT-based intervention is based on what we now know works regarding the treatment of a wide variety of psychological disorders. There is ample scientific evidence 
					that CBT is effective in the treatment of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, interpersonal problems, eating disorders, substance-related problems, psychotic disorders, impulse control disorders, insomnia and behavioural problems. Treatment is often based on a specific protocol, with brief, direct, 
					and time-limited treatments for specific psychological disorders

				<h2 class="h2" id="anger">ANGER</h2>
				<h3 class="h3">DEFINING ANGER</h3>
				<p class="p">
					The most common costs of anger are the destruction it causes to personal relationships. We make ourselves angry at the ones we love more often than 
					being angry with other people. <br><br>
					A lot of frustration arises in the workplace, we have deadlines to meet, difficult bosses, problems with staff, unfairness, and all these things can test 
					your patience. Your anger about frustrations can frustrate you more. Getting along with work colleagues is important to be able to succeed in the 
					workplace. Anger can effect these relationships negatively. <br><br>
					"Anger is a subjectively experienced emotional state with high sympathetic automatic arousal. It is initially elicited by a perception of a threat (to 
					one's physical well-being, property, present or future recourses, self-image, social status or projected image to one's group, maintenance of social 
					rules that regulate daily life, or comfort), although it may persist even after the threat has passed. Anger is associated with attributional, informational, 
					and evaluative cognitions that emphasise the misdeeds of others and motivate a response of antagonism to thwart, drive of, retaliate against, or attack 
					the source of the perceived threat. Anger is communicated through facial or postural gestures or vocal inflections, aversive verbalizations, and aggressive behaviour. One's choice of strategies to communicate anger varies with social roles, learning history, and environmental contingies."- DiGuiseppe & Tafrate in a 2007 publication (Understanding anger disorders) propose the following definition for anger
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">Constructs associated with Anger</h3>
				<p class="p">
					When understanding anger it is important to define constructs that are used to describe anger, aggression, hostility, hate and irritability. DiGuiseppe 
					& Tafrate provides working definitions for these constructs.
				</p>
				<p class="p"><b>Anger</b> is defined above.</p>
				<p class="p"><b>Aggression</b> is defined as overt motor behaviour enacted with the intent to do harm or injury to a person or object, with the expectation that harm will occur</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b>Hostility</b> refers to a semi permanent set of attitudes that can be either general or situational in nature. Such attitudes are related to both affective and 
					behavioural characteristics.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b>Hate</b> refers to an enduring negative affect of antagonism with a strong desire to effect revenge or hurt an opponent, without the physiological arousal 
					normally associated with anger. Hate can turn to anger if the person actually confronts the object of his or her hate.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b> Irritability </b>is defined as a complex construct that involves increased sensitivity to environmental stimulation that causes physiological arousal and 
					tension, without cognitive mediation, and that results in a lowered threshold to experience anger, and/or impulsive, but not premeditated, aggression.
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">Linking Anger to Depression and Anxiety</h3>
				<p class="p">
					A belief exists in psychology that anger is closely associated with depression and anxiety. Recent research suggests that anger is an emotion separate 
					from negative affectivity. Anxiety and depression are probably more closely related to each other than to anger
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">ANGER AND AGGRESSION</h3>
				<p class="p">
					To treat anger properly it is important to distinguish between anger and aggression. Anger can lead to aggression, but aggression is not anger.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					Others (court, spouse, employer) often refer people who experience difficulty with managing anger and aggression to psychotherapy. During psychotherapy, clients are quickly able to control their aggression, but continue to experience anger. It is a misconception that all people displaying aggression are actually angry. Studies show that some spouses showing aggression does not display physiological arousal associated with anger when they 
					assault their victims, they rather show the response that predatory animals do when they stalking their prey (Jacobson & Gottman(1998)).
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					It is thus important for treatment purposes to distinguish between anger and aggression.
				</p>
				<h4 class="h4">
					Considering anger as a mediator of violence
				</h4>
				<p class="p"> 
					Instrumental aggression is not having anger present and lacking an intention to harm others. The motive of instrumental aggression is to coerce others 
					into giving recources to the aggressor.
				</p>
				<p class="p"> 
					Affective aggression (also called hostile or reactive aggression, or rage) is defined as having anger present, being motivated by causing harm to 
					others, and is characterised by a cognitive style of impulsivity or lack of planning.
				</p>
				<p class="p"> 
					Research shows that the dichotomy of Instrumental vs. Affective aggression does not account for people who are for example suicide bombers. To 
					commit such an act they have to experience intense anger/hate but they do not act impulsively. It would be safer to say that multiple variations drive 
					aggression.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<br><b>Murder and anger </b><br> 
					Murder can be seen as a form of disturbed behaviour as murderers rarely achieve their desired ends, and they usually regret their actions and it usually 
					leads to harm for the perpetrator. Pincus (2001) uncovered three variables common to most murderers. Most of them suffered from some neurological 
					dysfunction that resulted in impaired impulse control. They suffered from some psychiatric disorder such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Diso`rder, or Schizoaffective Disorder. Lastly, the perpetrator experienced severe abuse during childhood. It seems that long-term, intense resentment about being 
					abused and shamed, and an inability to control impulses is key variables that may lead to anger in and an angry and aggressive episode.
					<br>The murder victim may not be the person who caused the most pain, but could rather be the last one in a long list of people who are perceived to have 
					insulted the murderer.<br><br>
					<b>Rape, Sexual Assault, and Anger</b><br> 
					Anger may motivate rape. Sex offenders have frequently suffered harsh treatment, neglect and rejection at the hands of family members and others. 
					Rapists may therefore be particularly sensitive to perceived rejection, leading to shame and anger. Sexual offending may be a behaviour pattern that 
					is used to restore a sense of worth and perceived control.<br><br>
					<b>Domestic violence and Anger</b><br>
					Anger may play a significant role in domestic violence. Spousal abuse is a rampant problem word wide. Studies in the USA suggest that 12-18% of 
					all murders are spousal assaults. Forty percent of woman murdered each year die at the hands of their husbands (Sigler, 1989). Research suggests that 
					not all perpetrators of partner violence are alike. <br>
				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">
					Diagnosing Anger as a disorder
				</h3>
				<p class="p">
					DiGiuseppe and Tafrate (Understanding anger disorders,2007) suggest a new diagnosis in an attempt to describe anger that is disordered. Their proposed Anger Regulation-Expression Disorder (ARED) is as follows.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					Diagnostic Criteria for Anger Regulation-Expression Disorder
				</p>

				<!-- CAROLINE START HERE -->
				<p class="p"> 
					 <b>A.</b>  Either (1) or (2)  
				</p>
				<p class="p"> 
					 <b>1.</b> Significant angry affect as indicated by frequent, intense, or enduring anger episodes that have persisted for at least six-months. 
					</p>
				<p class="p">
					 Two or more of the following characteristics are present during or immediately following anger experiences: 
					</p>
				<p class="p">
					<br>(a) Physical activation (e.g. increased heart rate, rapid breathing, muscle tension, stomach related symptoms, headaches) 
					<br> (b) Rumination that interferes with concentration, task performance, problem-solving, or decision-making <br> (c) Cognitive distortions (e.g. biased attributions regarding the intentions of others; inflexible demanding view of others' unwanted behaviours, code
					of conduct, or typical inconveniences; low tolerance for discordant events; condemnation of global rating of others who engage in perceived transgressions)
					<br> (d) Ineffective communication
					<br> (e) Brooding or withdrawal
					<br> (f) Subjective distress (e.g., awareness of negative consequences associated with anger episodes, anger experiences perceived as negative additional
					negative feelings such as guilt, shame, or regret follow anger episodes)

				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b>2.</b> A marked pattern of aggressive/expressive behaviors associated with anger episodes. Expressive patterns are out of proportion to the triggering
event. However, anger experiences need not be frequent, of high intensity, or of long duration. At least one of the following expressive patterns is consistently related to anger experiences:
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					Direct Aggression/Expression
				</p>
				<p class="p">
				<br>		(a) Aversive verbalizations (e.g., yelling, screaming, arguing nosily, criticizing using sarcasm insulting)
				<br>		(b) Physical aggression toward people (e.g., pushing, shoving, hitting, kicking, throwing objects)
				<br>		(c) Destruction of property
				<br>		(d) Provocative bodily expression (negative gesticulation, menacing or threatening movements, physical obstruction of others)
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					Indirect Aggression/Expression
				<br> (e) Intentionally failing to meet obligations or live up to others' expectations
				<br> (f) Covertly sabotaging (e.g., secretly destroying property, interfering with task completion, creating problems for others)
				<br> (g) Disrupting or negatively influencing others' social network (e.g., spreading rumors, gossiping, defamation, excluding others from important activities).

				</p>
				<p class ="p">
				<b>B.</b>	There is evidence of regular damage to social or vocational relationships due to
the anger episodes or expressive patterns.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b>C.</b> The angry or expressive symptoms are not better accounted for by another
					mental disorder (e.g., Substance Use disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia,
					or a personality disorder) or medical condition.
					
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					<b>Code based on type:</b>
					<br>Anger Disorder, Predominately Subjective Type
					<br> Anger Disorder, Predominately Expressive Type
					<br> Anger Disorder, Combined Types

				</p>
				<h3 class="h3">
					TREATMENT OF ANGER PROBLEMS

				</h3>
				<h4 class="h4">
					Attitudes likely to interfere with treatment
				</h4>
				<p class="p">
					Angry people tend to focus on the unwanted behaviour of others. An angry client's attitudes might include the following:
				</p>
				<p class = "p"> <b>Accurately assessing the intensity of anger experienced</b> <br>
					Angry people tend not to evaluate their anger as excessive due to not being socialised to react with alternative emotions. Their family, cultural or peer
					context may have not modelled alternative emotional reactions. They thus assess their anger to be appropriate. When the therapist attempts to discus
					the client's behaviour they would find it difficult to convince the client that their anger is extreme.
				</p>
				<p class = "p"> <b>Taking emotional responsibility</b> <br>
					Angry people tend to blame others for their anger. They see the reason for their anger, as outside themselves, thus others must change not me. The
client will find it hard to accept that he is responsible for his own anger.
				 </p>
				 <p class ="p"> <b>Condemning others</b> <br>
					Angry people usually view the recipient of their anger as a worthless human being worthy of being condemned and needing to pay for their transgression. They client will again find it hard to accept responsibility.
				 </p>
				 <p class = "p"> <b> Self-Righteousness</b> <br>
					Angry people believe they have been wronged or treated unfairly; they would rarely be prepared to investigate their role in a conflict.
				</p>
				<p class = "p"> <b>Expressing anger </b> <br>
					A general belief exist that people must express their anger, otherwise it will build up and they may explode. This is of course an incorrect notion.
				</p>
				<p class = "p"> <b> Short-Term reinforcement</b> <br>
					Angry people are reinforced by the compliance of significant others secondary to their anger. This is contrasted with the long-term negative effects
					that are not considered.
				</p>
				<p class = "p"> <b>Rigid demands </b> <br>
					The person who is viewed as the source of anger should act differently. A demand is placed on this person to have absolutely needing to have acted
					differently and that they are condemnable as a terrible person for not adhering to the angry persons demand. The rules made are usually moral in
					nature, such as people should not cut in front of me when I am driving.
				</p>
				<h4 class ="h4">Using CBT (specifically REBT) to treat Anger </h4>
				<p class="p"> We will use Road Rage as an example to demonstrate the principles.
					<br> We will start with the C (Consequence)
				</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>Unhealthy negative feeling (C) - Anger, rage.</b> </p>
				<p class="p"> <b>B (Belief) Destructive or Irrational Belief (iB</b> 
					 - You could be telling yourself, how can this person dare to just cut in front of me, he should not be
					allowed to do such a thing, it is damn terrible. He is such an idiot for driving like this. I cannot stand people driving like this. 
				</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>A (Adversity)</b> - Someone cuts in front of me while driving. 
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					Lets put it together:
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					I drive, someone cuts in front of me (A), I think/perceive (B); "How can this person dare to just cut in front of me, he should not be allowed to do
such a thing, it is damn terrible. He is such an idiot for driving like this. I cannot stand people driving like this". This leads to (C), Anger /rage and behaviours like shouting, swearing and hand signs.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					The four main iB's that people subscribe to are:
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					How awful for people to treat me so inconsiderately and unfairly. <br>
I can't stand their treating me that way. <br>
They absolutely should not, must not behave so badly. <br>
Because they are acting so terribly, they are terrible people, who don't deserve a good life, and who should be punished. <br>
If we go back to the problem of angering yourself when driving, you can see that the unhealthy Consequence (C) stems from your correctly connecting the driver and his irresponsible action and from your incorrectly damning him - his entire personhood for this action. To remain rational you can
evaluate the drivers unjust behaviour while refusing to put him down as a horrible person.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					REBT helps you to identify the mindsets (B's) associated with A's that leads to the C's that disturb you (anger, rage) and gets you into trouble.
				</p>
				<p class="p">
					You will notice that you-like many other people- make yourself disturbed, when you subscribe to the iB's mentioned above.
				 </p>
				 <p class="p">
					Lets review Demandingness in a bit more detail:
				 </p>
				 <h4 class="h4"> Musts or demands</h4>
				 <p class="p"> <b>Irrational achievement and approval musts</b> <br> 
					"I must do well, win the approval of others, and never get rejected or else I am a rotten, inadequate person."
				</p>
				<p class="p"> If you believe this idea, as many do, then you would to a degree come to a logical conclusion (based on this assumption) that "I am a rotten or inferior
					person, I will rarely succeed, so what is the use trying?" 
				</p>
				<p class="p"> 
					This cause you to withdraw, avoid and to feelings of self-hatred and anxiety
				</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>Irrational musts about others</b> <br> "Others must treat me considerately and kindly and in precise the way I want them to treat me. If they don't they are bad people and should be damned
					for their awful behaviour." This irrational must leads to anger, as in our driver example. 
				</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>Irrational musts about life conditions</b> <br>
					"The world (and the people in it) must be arranged so that I get practically everything that I really want when I want it. Further to that, conditions
					must be arranged so that I don't get what I don't want. </p>
				<h4 class="h4"> Insights into self-angering beliefs </h4>
				<p class="p"> Other people may try to get you angry, but you choose to make yourself angry. You do so by creating iB's about others 'unfair' and 'unjust' behaviours.

				</p>
				<p class="p"> Try and achieve the following insights from REBT with regards to your anger.</p>
				<p class="p">You are angered by your belief based on the current Adversity (someone cutting in front of you). It is not your past, not how your father drove or what
					other drivers did to you, it is about your response to the current situation. The view you hold now. Your past can play a role in the beliefs you prefer,
					but you still choose to think them now. 
				</p>
				<p class="p">Secondly, no matter how you iB's came about you choose to keep them alive by continually practising them. Whenever someone cut in front of you,
					you choose to think the same thoughts about the situation over and over again. 
				 </p>
				 <p class="p"> Thirdly, in order to change your disturbed feelings and behaviour and the thoughts that lead to them, you will have to do a great amount of work and
					practice.
				</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>Disputing your iB's</b> </p>
				<p class="p">  <b>1. Rational Belief:</b>  "I dislike it if people cut in front of me when I am driving and I would strongly prefer people not cutting in front of me." Irrational
					Belief: "You absolutely must not cut in front of me, you should never act in that way towards me."
				 </p>
				 <p class="p"> <b>2. Rational Belief: </b> "Because you are treating me unfairly by cutting in front of me, your behaviour is wrong and poor, and you preferably should correct it." Irrational belief: "Because you are treating me unfairly by cutting in front of me, you absolutely must not; you are a rotten person who should
					be damned and severely punished."  
				</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>3. Rational Belief</b> "It is highly unpleasant when you cut in front of me, and I would prefer that you do not do it." Irrational belief: "It is awful and terrible when you cut in front of me, and you must not. Nothing can be worse than this."
					Each of the statements starts with a rational preference and ends up with an irrational command that the driver should not cut in front of you.  
				</p>
				<p class="p"> You can Dispute these irrational beliefs by asking yourself the following questions:

				</p>
				<p class="p"> 
					Disputing: Is it true that people can absolutely not cut in front of me? Do I have the power to decide for other people that they cannot cut in front of
me? Will other people not cut in front of me because I say they may not? Is their any reason that the driver absolutely should not treat me as badly as
he treated me? Can nothing be worse than the way this driver treated me? Is the driver condemnable as a person for cutting in front of me?
				</p>
				<h4 class="h4">The Beginning </h4>
				<p class="p">This information on anger is only a small peep into CBT and it's working.</p>
				<p class="p">Should you struggle with anger and it leads to difficulties in your close relationships, work functioning and social relationships don't hesitate to contact a psychotherapist. We would believe a CBT therapist would be able to help you.</p>
				<p class="p">My thanks to the work of Albert Ellis, Raymond Chip Tarate and Raymond DiGiuseppe.</p>

				<h2 id="ANXIETY" class="h2">ANXIETY</h2>
				<h3 class="h3">WHAT IS ANXIETY</h3>
				<p class="p"> Anxiety is an emotion associated with a sense of uneasiness and apprehension. It is a future orientated emotional response in reaction to the perception of threat of some kind. Anxiety, fear and panic tend to revolve around the perception of threat toward one's physical well-being and safety, one's 
					acceptability in social situations or one's emotional state. The thought processes associated with anxiety tend to be future orientated. Thinking is 
					often repetitive and rumination is often present. Anxiety tends to be accompanied by behavioural responses that are orientated toward avoidance of 
					the anxiety-provoking stimulus.</p>
				<p class="p">A diversity of physical symptoms of varying intensities associated with autonomic nervous system arousal may develop. These would include: </p>

<!-- IMAGE of Three inter locking circles goes here  -->
				<ul class="p"> 
				<li>Heart palpitations or accelerated heart rate</li>
				<li>Sweating</li>	
				<li>Trembling or shaking</li>
				<li>Sensations of shortness of breath or an elevated respiratory (breathing) rate</li>
				<li>Chest pain or discomfort or a sense of pressure on the chest</li>
				<li>Nausea or abdominal distress</li>
				<li>Feelings of dizziness or light-headedness</li>
				<li> Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depresonalization (feeling detached from oneself)</li>
				<li>Feelings of numbness or tingling</li>
				<li>Cold chills or hot flushes</li>
				<li>Impaired attention and concentration</li>
				<li>Restlessness</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p"> <b>FEAR</b> is seen as a response to a known, external, definite threat (e.g. a 
					snake or a gun being pointed at you) as oppose to anxiety 
					that is often experienced in response to an unknown or more vague and less 
					definite threat that is often not immediately 
					present.</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>PANIC</b> on the other hand is defined as an intense episode of intense dread 
					or fear. Panic tends to have an abrupt onset as oppose to gradually building 
					anxious arousal. It is associated with an intense urge to escape and less 
					often with urges to fight. The tendency to flee or escape is supported by 
					strong autonomic nervous system arousal and includes intense symptoms 
					such as those listed above. The perception of threat is imminent with panic, 
					whereas with anxiety the threat is seen as more future orientated

				<h3 class="h3">ANXIETY DISORDERS</h3>
				<h4 class="h4">HEALTHY vs UNHEALT HY ANXIETY</h4>
				<p class="p"> Many "negative" or unpleasant emotional reactions may be seen as either healthy and functional or unhealthy and dysfunctional.
				</p>
				<p class="p">For instance, if someone feels extreme fear during the course of an armed robbery or symptoms of anxiety before or during an oral examination then 
					this may be unpleasant and uncomfortable but it may not necessarily be unhealthy or dysfunctional. In fact, fear and anxiety may actually be extremely helpful. If humans (and animals) did not have the ability to fear, then we would all have been extinct by now! Fear and anxiety really does 
					help keep us alive! Certain scenarios really do require fear as a protective mechanism, such as swimming with sharks in deep water, falling from a 
					dangerous height, walking down a dangerous alley at night or sleeping with your doors unlocked. If we did not fear these scenarios or feel some concern or anxiety about them, then none of us would behave in such a manner so as to prevent these realistically dangerous situations from occurring</p>
				<p class="p">Unhealthy or dysfunctional anxiety on the other hand can generally be defined by the following criteria:</p>
				<ul class="p"> 
					<li>The perception of threat is seen to be greater than the objective degree of threat</li>
					<li>The anxiety tends to impair an individual's ability to function within their respective roles and their environment</li>
					<li>The anxiety is perceived as distressing and unwanted</li>
					<li>The anxiety is perceived as distressing and unwanted</li>
					<li>The anxiety and its associated symptoms are experienced over an extended period of time which is not objectively necessary</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 class="h4">WHAT IS AN ANXIETY DISORDER?</h4>
				<p class="p"> Anxiety disorders are probably the most common of all psychiatric and psychological disorders. They are however also probably one of the most 
					responsive groups of psychological disorders to treatment from a CBT perspective.</p>
				<p class="p">In order for a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder to be made, a thorough clinical assessment is required and such an assessment would need to reveal 
					the following:
					</p>
				<ul class="p"> 
					<li>That prominent symptoms of anxiety are present and that those symptoms are experienced as distressing</li> 
				<li>That the symptoms have been present for a significant period of time (that meets the minimum time period criteria for that diagnosis)</li>
				<li>That the symptoms cause a sufficient amount of disturbance or impairment in an individual's ability to function at work or school, within social settings and in other important areas of functioning</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p">While some individuals may experience what is referred to as sub-clinical or "less severe and disabling" symptoms of anxiety, most anxiety symptoms fall into one of the following categories</p>
				<ul class="p">
					<li> Panic disorder and agoraphobia</li>
					<li>Specific phobias</li>
					<li> Social phobia</li>
					<li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
					<li>Post-traumatic stress disorder</li>
					<li>Generalized anxiety disorder</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="p">Professionals trained in the diagnosis of anxiety disorders would include psychiatrists, psychologists and general practitioners. For an accurate diagnosis to be made, a mental health professional well trained in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is often required. Making 
					an accurate diagnosis is of extreme importance. The reason for this is that CBT-based treatments for anxiety disorders are becoming more disorder 
					specific. This is as a result of ongoing theoretical and treatment developments that inform more specific treatment planning. As a result, successful 
					treatment is generally highly dependent upon an accurate diagnosis being made. Knowing that someone has anxiety is insufficient for disorder specific treatment planning.</p>
				<h4 class="h4"> WHAT IS THE COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS? </h4>
				<p class="p"> Cognitive-behavioural theory for anxiety disorders has grown rather significantly over the last few decades. More recent additions to our understanding of the development and treatment of anxiety disorders have taken place as a result of significant advances in neuroscience (McNally, 2007). See 
					our LINKS PAGE to the very interesting Le Doux Laboratory website in this regard. These developments together with pre-existing cognitive and 
					behavioural theory have assisted in informing our theoretical understanding and treatment approaches within modern day clinical psychology.</p>
				<p class="p">The development, maintenance and successful treatment of anxiety disorders is seen as being related to a number of factors.
					<br> <b>PREDISPOSING DEVELOPMENTAL FACTORS</b> are factors that are present from early on in childhood, that tend to increase the risk of the development of an anxiety disorder. These would include factors such as</p>
					<ul class="p "> 
						<li>Family history of anxiety (genetic predisposition)</li>
						<li>Temperamental style associated with anxiousness and greater physiological reactivity and…</li>
						<li>… a particular thinking style that may predispose one toward anxiety
							Early trauma, early parental separation or unstable living conditions in childhood</li>
					</ul>

				<p class="p"> <b>PRECIPITATING DEVELOPMENTAL FACTORS</b> are factors that contribute greatly toward the onset of a first episode of anxiety or an experience during which fear conditioning (see below) may take place. These may vary across the different anxiety disorders. They may include a variety 
					of factors such as:</p>
				<ul class="p"> 
					<li>A traumatic event (motor vehicle accident or mugging)</li>
					<li>An unpleasant and uncomfortable encounter with an animal (e.g. a bird or a dog) especially during childhood</li>
					<li>Unpleasant and uncomfortable physical symptoms associated with a medical condition (e.g. feelings of shortness of breath related to asthma)</li>
					<li>Experience of someone else suffering a serious medical condition (e.g. parent having a heart attack) </li>
					<li>Unremitting pressure and stress at work</li>
					<li> Some other uncomfortable experience during which one responds with a significant amount of anxiety</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="p">Precipitating developmental factors may also include a number of other internal physiological factors that may "set one up" with high levels of physiological arousal such as intoxication, illness, sleep deprivation or caffeine intoxication or physiological factors such as thyroid problems, intense 
					headache or migraine, a heart attack or changes in other biological variables such as blood carbon dioxide levels.</p>
				<p class="p"> <b>FEAR CONDITIONING</b> is the process during which all of the above factors come together. During fear conditioning, neutral or "non dangerous" 
					stimuli are strongly associated with "dangerous" stimuli or the perception of threat and the fear response (Mc Nally, 2007).</p>
<!-- IMAGE of Three circles and arrows goes here  -->
                  <p class="p">These neutral stimuli may be internal. For example:</p>
				  <ul class="p">
					  <li>Elevated heart rate or light-headedness in the case of people suffering from panic disorder</li>
					  <li>The thought that one's hands are dirty and must be washed in the case of people suffering with OCD - 
						contamination type</li>
					  <li>A memory of a past traumatic event in the case of someone suffering from PTSD</li>

				  </ul>
				  <p class="p "> These stimuli are however often also external. For example:</p>
				  <ul class="p"> <li>Driving on the N1 in the case of people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a motor vehicle accident</li>
				<li>Standing on a ladder in the case of someone with a phobia of heights</li>
				<li>Being the last one to enter a room full of people in the case of someone suffering with social phobia</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p"> The brain learns that these "previously neutral" stimuli are dangerous and should be feared and avoided. Fear conditioning may occur during a single 
					event or over a period of time as a result of repeated experiences.</p>
				<p class="p">This learning tends to however be inaccurate in the case of anxiety disorders where the degree of threat associated with these stimuli tends to be overestimated and the fear response is thus exaggerated.</p>
				<p class="p">There are a number of different learning systems within the brain. The anatomical structure most central to fear condition is the amygdala, a tiny pea 
					shaped structure that lies alongside the hippocampus (also involved in learning, memory and anxiety) in an anatomical cluster of nuclei referred to 
					as the limbic system. Other structures within the limbic system have however also been implicated as being highly involved with anxiety disorders.</p>
				<p class="p">Once fear conditioning has taken place, the anxiety disorder and fear response that goes along with that tends to be rather resistant to change. The 
					amygdala learns what "should be feared" very quickly and it remembers those fear stimuli very well but it's not all that good at later learning that 
					those stimuli are not actually dangerous. This is a much slower, more resistant process that relies on the strengthening of inhibitory pathways from 
					the medial pre-frontal cortex that shut the amygdala's fear response down (Davis, 2002). The amygdala is a structure lower down in the brain and it 
					is what we would refer to as a more primal structure. Without it we would have no fear response and thus be extremely vulnerable to danger, death 
					and extinction. The problem with the overly-sensitive or overly-reactive amygdala is that it is not very good at distinguishing between various contexts. An overly sensitive and reactive amygdala is also not very good at distinguishing more subtle differences between stimuli involved during fear 
					conditioning vs. non-dangerous stimuli that are encountered after fear conditioning has taken place. As a result, it sees anything that resembles the 
					feared stimulus as signalling danger. This is why an individual with a snake phobia will have a phobic response to a picture of a snake in a magazine, 
					two metres away. The non-dangerous stimulus (picture of snake in magazine) is present and this is all the amygdala needs to react. It does not distinguish between contexts and therefore does not realize that this stimulus and this context is non-dangerous.</p>
				<p class="p"> The other problem with the amygdala is that it is extremely quick in its perception of threat and its reaction to it. The primal nature of this structure 
					allows it to receive incoming sensory information and react to it before the conscious brain is even aware of it (Harvey, Bryant & Tarrier, 2003). This 
					is why people with anxiety disorders will often report that they started to feel anxious before they have even had any thoughts going through their 
					mind. The amygdala is a protective structure that will initiate the fear response before we are consciously aware of the stimulus. It's similar to the automatic response that you have to placing your hand on a hot object. The brain and spinal cord have automatic reflex mechanisms that perceive the 
					danger of the hot object and allow you to immediately remove your hand from the object before you have necessarily consciously realized that your 
					hand is burning. If we had to wait for the thinking part of the brain (the cortex) to first realize that there is some threat then we would take too long 
					to react to it. This is also why it is difficult to "think your way out of anxiety", because the fear response is often initiated before conscious cognition 
					is present, so the anxiety has a head start. This is also why traditional "talk therapy" is rather unhelpful in treating anxiety disorders and why reconditioning or prolonged exposure is so important.</p>
				
	<!-- IMAGE of four circles goes here  -->
         <p class="p"> DYSFUNCTIONAL THINKING is associated with the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders (Beck & Emery, 1985). It is possible 
			that dysfunctional ways of thinking may sometimes cause anxiety on their own but dysfunctional thinking is often the conscious brain's reaction 
			during fear conditioning. Dysfunctional thinking may however also develop in response to anxiety. We call this secondary disturbance (Walen, 
			DiGiuseppe & Dryden, 1992) and much of the initial stages of cognitive therapy is orientated toward reducing anxiety about anxiety. Exactly 
			when during the development of anxiety, thinking plays its role, is less important than the fact that we know that it contributes toward maintaining 
			it and that it's helpful to challenge dysfunctional thinking as a critical component to treatment</p>
		<p class="p"> The dysfunctional thinking styles that people with anxiety disorders present with tend to revolve around multiple themes. Some examples of dysfunctional thinking would include the following</p>

		<ul class="p">
			<li>Overestimation of the degree of threat of a particular situation <br>
				Snake Phobia "if I walk on the mountain then I will be bitten by a snake (and die)" <br>
				Panic Disorder "if I have a panic attack, then I will have a heart attack (and die)" <br>
				PTSD "if I drive on the N1 again then I will end up in an accident" <br>
				OCD "If I have a blasphemous thought again like this, then something terrible will happen to me"
			   </li>
			   <li>Confusing low probability with high probability <br>
				PTSD "there is a 50% chance that I will be sexually assaulted again" <br>
				Flying Phobia "there's a fifty-fifty chance that the plane could crash" </li>
				<li>Catastrophising or Awfulizing or regularly predicting the worst-case scenario <br>
					Social Phobia "they'll think I'm crazy if they see that I'm anxious and that would be terrible" <br>
					GAD "it would be horrible if I don't get the job, and then I may never get another one" <br>
					Panic Disorder "it would be awful if I had another panic attack"</li>
				<li> Underestimating one's ability to cope with an adverse situation also referred to as Low Frustration/Discomfort Tolerance (LFT) <br>
					Panic Disorder "I can't handle the panic attacks" <br>
					All Anxiety "I can't handle those feelings of anxiety" <br>
					OCD "I can't stand the urge to wash my hands, it's too much" <br>
					OCD/GAD "The uncertainty is just too much to bare, I must know for certain" <br></li>
				<li>Overgeneralization (predicting that if something bad had happened once, that it will always happen again) <br>
					PTSD "I'll never be able to drive on the N1 without having an accident again" <br>
					PTSD "All men are thinking of sexually assaulting me when they look at me" <br>
					Social Phobia "I'll always be anxious in front of strangers"</li>
				<li>Demandingness: "Should" or "Must" statements or imperatives that tend to increase anxiety <br>
					Agoraphobia "I must not be anxious" <br>
					Social Phobia "Other people must not have a negative opinion of me or judge me" <br>
					GAD/Performance Anxiety "I have to get an A for my exam" <br>
					Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia "I should have total control at all times over my anxiety"</li>
				
				<li>Negative Self-Rating, where one judges the whole of oneself as bad, inadequate, worthless or unlovable <br>
					Social Phobia "Getting so anxious makes me a weak person and other people will think this of me " <br> 
					GAD/Performance Anxiety "I'm such a failure for having failed at that task" <br>
					Anxiety within Relationships "If I do all these things and I still can't get John to love me then I must be unlovable"</li>

				<li>Misinterpretation of the meaning or danger of physical symptoms <br>
					All Anxiety "If I allow myself to get so anxious then It might become totally out of control" <br>
					Panic Disorder "I'll have a stroke if these panic attacks continue" <br>
					Claustrophobia "I won't be able to breath and I'll end up suffocating" 
				   </li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p">As previously mentioned, there are at least two parallel systems involved in fear conditioning. The one is involved in more sub-concious fear conditioning and reaction to sensory cues and the other involves more conscious sensory perception and thought (Brewin, 2001; Dalgleish, 2004)</p>
				<p class="p">Anxiety provoking or anxiety maintaining beliefs may be the result of years of repetitive dysfunctional thinking patters which may be driven by 
					what is referred to as underlying dysfunctional cognitive schema's or core beliefs, which often develop out of experience. For example, a child that 
					grows up experiencing numerous unexpected and traumatic or difficult events may develop certain beliefs about the probability of "something bad 
					happening". This may later on lead to an intolerance of uncertainty and an associated tendency to catastrophize and predict the worst-case scenario. This may function as one of the thinking or cognitive mechanisms that underlies generalized anxiety disorder or chronic w </p>

				<p class="p">Dysfunctional beliefs may however also develop in conjunction with or in reaction to more automatic fear conditioning. For example, people with 
panic disorder may not have any particular dysfunctional thinking styles that result in their initial panic attack. Further panic attacks may however 
be initiated by dysfunctional thinking about the nature of panic. </p>

<!-- IMAGE of three rectangular pictures goes here  -->

              <p class="p"> MAINTAINING FACTORS tend to revolve around avoidance behaviour. Avoidance behaviours tend to actually exacerbate or maintain anxiety. 
				Avoidance always seems like a good solution (because in the short term it is anxiety-reducing) but it's actually a symptom of an anxiety disorder 
				and tends to make things worse.</p>
				<p class="p"> The brain falsely learns during fear conditioning that certain "non-dangerous" stimuli "are dangerous" and should be feared and avoided". There is 
					really only one way in which the brain is able to learn that this is in fact untrue and that the "feared stimulus" is in fact quite safe and does not need 
					to be feared or avoided. This is through a technique referred to as prolonged exposure or extinction training (Rothbaum & Foa, 1992). During prolonged exposure the brain learns that the "non-dangerous" feared stimulus is in fact not dangerous and as a result the brain stops reacting to it with 
					fear and the behavioural tendency to avoid.</p>
				<p class="p">Avoidance prevents the brain from learning that the non-dangerous feared stimulus is in fact not actually threatening and does not need to be 
					feared or avoided</p>
				<p class="p"> Avoidance thus ensures that the fear stimulus is either never encountered or is only encountered for short periods of time before escape is initiated, 
					as illustrated in the graph above. As a result, prolonged exposure cannot occur if the feared stimulus is never encountered for significant periods of 
					time. Avoidance thus ensures that the association between non-dangerous stimuli and the perception of danger and fear remains, which obviously 
					keeps the fear response intact and the anxiety disorder in place.</p>
				<p class="p"> Avoidance may include basic behavioural avoidance and more subtle avoidance behaviours such as alcohol abuse or the use of prescription medication such as tranquilizers or benzodiazepine medication, that all assist in reducing the symptoms of anxiety (whilst the substance is in ones 
					body) but seldom lead to sustained symptom reduction. This is because the association between the feared stimulus and the fear reaction remains 
					and is merely avoided.
					</p>
				<h4 class="p"> WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS TO COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS?</h4>
				<p class="p"> The cognitive behavioural therapy approach toward the understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders differs somewhat between each of the 
					disorders. There are however a number of concepts and treatment approaches that are central to most treatment approaches for all anxiety disorders. These are outlined below. Please refer to the sections on each of the respective anxiety disorders for a short summary of what CBT-based 
					treatment entails for each of the respective disorders.
					</p>
				<p class="p"> The purpose of cognitive-behavioural therapy is to assist individuals in altering their emotional distress and dysfunctional behavioural patterns. 
					This is no different to most other psychotherapy approaches. The ways of understanding anxiety and the methods employed in treating it are however very specific and rather unique to CBT. From a cognitive-behavioural therapy perspective, anxiety disorders are seen as the result of inappropriate fear conditioning and dysfunctional ways of evaluating the degree of threat of the feared stimulus.
				</p>
				<p class="p"> THE COGNITIVE MODEL proposes that it is not merely a potential adverse situation that leads to panic, fear, anxiety and worry but the way in 
					which we think about it (Beck &Emery, 1985; Ellis & Harper, 1961). Cognitive theory proposes that irrational or dysfunctional ways of thinking 
					about a particular stimulus or event would result in unhealthy fear and anxiety about that stimulus or event.</p>
				<p class="p"> Cognitive therapy is thus aimed at identifying those thoughts, attitudes and assumptions that create, exacerbate or maintain unnecessary fear and 
					anxiety. Some of these thinking patterns may be very obvious and conscious whilst others may sit a little below conscious awareness, but easily 
					elicited and identifiable with the correct interviewing techniques. Once identified, these thoughts, assumptions and attitudes are assessed in a scientific manner with regards to the following:
				</p>
				<ul class="p">
					<li> Whether they follow logical reasoning</li>
					<li>Whether or not they are based on any objective evidence</li>
					<li> Whether they are helpful or self-defeating and anxiety provoking.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p"> A variety of different types of irrational ways of thinking may be identified as shown in the section above on Dysfunctional Thinking. Once identified these thoughts, attitudes and assumptions are disputed or challenged and ultimately replaced by healthier, more evidence based, logical cognitions or way of thinking. These healthier thinking styles are then practiced repeatedly and with different methods that enable people to develop a 
					stronger level of conviction for these healthier ways of thinking (Walen, DiGiuseppe & Dryden, 1992). This tends to assist in reducing anxiety and 
					reducing avoidance. However, as previously mentioned, it is very difficult to "think your way out of anxiety". This is because the pre-frontal 
					cortex or thinking part of the brain is quite good at activating the amygdala but not all that good at shutting it down. This is where the behavioural 
					model comes into play.</p>
<!-- IMAGE of four rectangular pictures goes here  -->
                 <p class="p">THE BEHAVIOURAL MODEL proposes that anxiety disorders result from inappropriate fear conditioning. This means that the brain inaccurately 
					associates non-dangerous stimuli in non-dangerous contexts with the perception of threat and the fear response. The behavioural model is now 
					substantiated and further informed by significant advances in neuroscience (McNally, 2007). The behavioural model proposes that avoidant coping 
					responses only serve to exacerbate and maintain the inaccurate association between non-dangerous stimuli in non-dangerous contexts with the 
					perception of danger and the fear response.
					</p>
				<p class="p" > It proposes prolonged exposure or extinction training as the solution to this inaccurate association and suggests this as the only way in which 
					non-dangerous stimuli in non-dangerous contexts can be accurately associated with the perception of safety and a non-anxious response. The problem with exposure is that anyone with an anxiety disorder will initially respond with the fear response and with significant symptoms of anxiety. 
					As a result, most people tend to leave the situation and escape or avoid it. This does not give the brain sufficient time to learn that the feared consequences do not actually occur or that the anxiety is tolerable or does eventually reduce. This is why exposure must be prolonged. It needs to be 
					long enough for the brain to have the opportunity to realize how these stimuli do not need to be feared. Exposure also needs to be long enough for 
					the brain to begin rewiring itself and developing inhibitory pathways from the medial pre-frontal cortex to the central nucleus of the amygdala, 
					that shut the fear response down.
					</p>
				<p class="p"> There are four types of prolonged exposure that are used with varying degrees according to the anxiety disorder that is being treated (Choy, Fyer, 
					Lipsitz, 2007).
					</p>
				<p class="p"> PROLONGED IN-VIVO EXPOSURE
					Prolonged in-vivo exposure is a technique that is used with individuals who are suffering from anxiety disorders where the feared stimulus is external. Prolonged exposure is done to the feared stimulus that has previously been avoided in response to the anxiety. Prolonged in-vivo exposure 
					is used with most anxiety disorders but most often forms a significant component to treatment planning with specific phobias, social phobia, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder
				</p>
				<!-- @EvilSocks css class -->
				<p class="p"> PROLONGED IMAGINAL EXPOSURE <br>
					Prolonged imaginal exposure is a technique that is primarily used with individuals who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Imaginal 
					exposure is used with anxiety disorders where the feared stimulus is imaginal (an image). Memories of traumatic experiences trigger a great deal 
					of anxiety and panic in individuals suffering from PTSD. The memories and all that triggers them are seen as the non-dangerous stimuli, which 
					trigger the perception of threat and the fear response in PTSD. Exposure is thus done to the images and memories of the traumatic event until the 
					brain no longer reacts to them as dangerous (because they aren't, even though they may remain unpleasant). Imaginal exposure may also be used 
					in the treatment of other anxiety disorders as a preparatory step before in-vivo exposure. Imaginal exposure to images relating to the content of 
					worry, may also be done with people with generalized anxiety disorder.</p>
				<p class="p"> INTEROCEPTIVE EXPOSURE <br>
					Interoceptive exposure is a technique during which individuals are exposed to the internal physical sensations that they react to with fear, panic, 
					anxiety or worry. Interoceptive exposure is used primarily with people suffering from panic disorder, agoraphobia or claustrophobia. It is however 
					often also helpful as an adjunct to in-vivo exposure for phobias, especially when people are extremely anxious and fearful of their anxiety.
					</p>
				<p class="p"> VIRTUAL EXPOSURE <br>
					Virtual exposure is a technique that is used using virtual reality computer software that assists individuals with exposure exercises that would difficult to create in-vivo (real life). Virtual exposure is most often used with people who have a phobia of flying. This is because it is often difficult 
					and very expensive to do in-vivo exposure with aircraft.</p>
	<!-- IMAGE of thee circles pictures goes here  -->
	            <p class="p"> Each of these exposure techniques are ultimately aimed at assisting the brain to build stronger associations between the non-dangerous stimulus 
					and the perception of safety that tend to overpower associations between the non-dangerous stimulus and the perception of danger and the fear 
					response. Prolonged exposure is a very powerful and extremely successful technique that assist in reducing symptoms of many anxiety disorders. 
					Our clinical experience would suggest that prolonged exposure is most useful after an initial cognitive therapy intervention and a significant 
					amount of psycho-education.
