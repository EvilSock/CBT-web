				<h3 class="h3" > WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF CBT?</h3> 
				<p class="p"> The fundamental theoretical positions underlying the cognitive behavioural model are derived partly from ancient philosophical traditions. Albert 
					Ellis and his theoretical model of REBT, which arguably provided the foundation upon which modern day CBT evolved, regularly cited Epictetus, 
					an ancient, Greek, stoic philosopher. Aaron (Tim) Beck has also made reference to the insightful ideas of the stoic philosophers. Epictetus (AD 55 
					- AD 135) suggested that "men are disturbed not by things, but by the view they take of them". This ultimately points toward what we now know 
					to be true; that the way in which we think essentially determines the way that we feel and react.
					</p>
				<p class="p"> Behaviourism or the behavioural model can be traced back to the nineteenth century where behavioural theory began to take shape. Behaviourism 
					proposes that all things that organisms do can be considered behaviours that can be observed, measured and scientifically described. Behavioural 
					theory thus focused only on measurable phenomena such as behaviour, and sought to intervene with psychological disturbance by shaping healthier behavioural patterns. Behavioural theory and intervention initially included concepts such as classical (i.e. Pavlov) and operant (i.e. Skinner) 
					conditioning and typically proposed that behaviour can be learned or unlearned depending on the consequences associated with it. Behaviour therapy became widely utilized throughout the first half of the 20th century and was influenced by the work of individuals such as Pavlov, Thorndike, 
					Watson and subsequently Skinner. Wolpe, originally South African, utilized scientific findings derived mainly from animal research in his development of what then became known as 'systematic desensitization'. This approach acted as the precursor to current day fear reduction techniques, 
					commonly now known as 'exposure therapy'.
					</p>
				<p class="p"> It was not until the 1960s that the cognitive model began to gain momentum. The therapeutic approaches of Albert Ellis' Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) and Aaron Beck's Cognitive Therapy (CT) provided the foundation for the cognitive aspects of CBT as we know it today. 
					Both Ellis and Beck emphasized the role of cognitions or beliefs as underlying emotional and behavioural disturbance. CBT, as it is known today, 
					essentially refers to a broad range of cognitive and behavioural theories and associated theory-driven intervention strategies that have co-occurred 
					under the umbrella of CBT since the 1980s and 1990s.
					</p>
				<h3 class="h3">WHAT IS BASIC CBT THEORY? </h3>
				<p class="p"> CBT incorporates the central theoretical principles of cognitive and behavioural therapy. CBT thus encompasses a variety of theoretical notions 
					and accompanying intervention strategies from two initially separate frameworks: <br>
					Cognitive therapy seeks to identify, evaluate and restructure dysfunctional beliefs that are considered central to emotional disturbance and self-defeating behaviour. <br>
					Behavioural techniques are utilized as a means of reducing emotional distress, altering dysfunctional behaviour and restructuring cognition. <br>
					The theoretical position taken by the cognitive model proposes that if we are able to identify the most relevant thoughts or beliefs underlying our 
					unwanted emotional and behavioural reactions, re-evaluate them and replace them with more appropriate alternatives, then we will most likely feel 
					and react in a healthier, more appropriate way. The key in cognitive therapy lies with being able to identify the most appropriate beliefs that need 
					to be targeted.
					 </p>
					<p class="p"> Novice and inexperienced CBT therapists and clients will often struggle to identify the most clinically relevant beliefs. Just because a belief co-occurs with an emotion or behaviour, does not necessarily mean that it is the most relevant belief perpetuating that emotion. Identifying the correct 
						cognitive content or process is thus important. In addition, what Beck has referred to as intermediate or core beliefs, and what Ellis has referred to 
						as core evaluative beliefs that are often more entrenched and more difficult to change, are often present but not verbally articulated and thus need 
						first, to be uncovered. Cognitive therapy thus often initially involves the uncovering of such attitudes, assumptions, rules and core beliefs prior to 
						any sort of intervention. Once identified, the most clinically relevant beliefs are typically evaluated as either helpful or unhelpful and then replaced 
						with healthier alternatives. This is referred to as 'cognitive restructuring' or 'cognitive disputation'. Clients are then often required to work at implementing these new ways of thinking within their natural environment so as to strengthen the influence of these healthier ways of thinking. The 
						mechanisms of change are however not quite as linear or simplistic as many seem to think, and behavioural changes may often also lead to cognitive changes. For example, once we have done something that we were previously afraid of doing, we often tend to no longer think of it as dangerous or threatening. The process of changing one's beliefs or behaviours often requires a great deal of time, dedication, practice and perseverance, 
						but it is certainly possible and tremendously empowering.
						 </p>
					<h3 class="h3"> CONCEPTUAL SCHEMA EXPLAINING CBT THEOR</h3>
				<p class="p"> The CBT model typically uses a schematic commonly referred to as the A-B-C model of emotional and behavioural disturbance. (A) in the model 
					typically refers to the Activating Event or adverse situation with which the individual is confronted. This could be a difficult interpersonal interaction, a stressful situation at work, a physical sensation, thought or emotional reaction. (B) refers to the thoughts or Beliefs that one then responds 
					to the activating event with, which is then seen as responsible for initiating or maintaining (C), the Emotional and Behavioural Consequences to 
					these beliefs. The three examples below illustrate the model using a typical scenario with panic disorder, OCD and depression</p>
				<p class="p"> The schematic would often include a second section with typical questions aimed at cognitive restructuring or Cognitive Disputation (D) that asists clients in evaluating the helpfulness of their beliefs and then provides them with an opportunity for developing new Effective Beliefs (E) that 
					would then lead to more Functional Emotional or Behavioural Reactions (F).</p>
<!-- Image of nine circled -->
				<h3 class="h3"> WHAT DOES CBT TARGET?</h3>
				<p class="p"> Almost all individuals who present for psychotherapy, present with some sort of an emotional or behavioural problem. Even those individuals who 
					think that their greatest problem is a practical one (disciplining their children/making a decision/dealing with difficult people) are typically prevented from managing their practical dilemma as a result of their emotional disturbance about it. One of the primary goals of CBT is thus to assist 
					individuals in reducing emotional distress, thereby experiencing more appropriate, healthy emotional reactions. Those who seek 'happiness' continuously are essentially misguided in the sense that positive emotions such as happiness, joy or calmness, whilst pleasurable, are typically 
					short-lived and unsustainable for longer periods of time. CBT therapists prefer to consider emotional reactions as either helpful and functional or 
					unhelpful and dysfunctional. The goal is to assist clients in shifting from unhelpful emotional states to more appropriate, manageable ones. </p>
				<p class="p"> As an example, many individuals who struggle with assertiveness are often inhibited by intense guilt about the way in which others may feel in 
					response to their decisions. While having sensitivity to other's feelings is certainly admirable and quite appropriate, feeling intense guilt about 
					others' feelings is often unhealthily inhibiting. In such a situation, one would typically want to reduce the likelihood of feeling guilt and shift such 
					an emotional response to something more moderate and tolerable such as regret or disappointment. Guilt in such a situation would typically be 
					fueled by beliefs such as "I must never do anything that others may not like" or that "I am personally responsible for others feelings".
					 </p>
				<p class="p">Regret on the other hand, would be based on more flexible, realistic beliefs such as "while I'd prefer to always make decisions that others are happy 
						with, there is no rule that states that I have to always place others satisfaction above my own and I am not personally responsible for others' happiness". Such a shift in belief allows one to be sensitive to others feelings, but not see their reactions as always more important that what may be in 
						ones own best interest. Such a restructuring of one's thinking would thus help to reduce the presence of unnecessary guilt and enable one to then 
						act in a more assertive manner, thereby also addressing the practical problem.
						 </p>
				<p class="p"> Below is a table of positive emotions, healthy negative emotions and unhealthy negative emotions:</p>

	<!-- Rectangualar image here -->
				<p class="p"> Simultaneously, behaviour may often also be targeted during intervention, but this is often (but not always) secondary to the initial emotional goal. 
					Many behavioural interventions target specific behaviours without any initial emotional goals. This would typically be the case with substance 
					related problems, procrastination, habit related disorders like tics, skin picking or trichotillomania, and insomnia. Behavioural reactions associated 
					with depression or anxiety-related problems may often also be targeted directly, with a change in one's emotional state being seen as secondary to 
					this. For instance, prolonged exposure to feared situations tends to result in a decrease in anxiety and becoming more actively involved in pleasurable activities tends to reduce feelings of depression</p>
				<h3 class="h3"> IRRATIONAL OR DYSFUNCTIONAL BELIEFS?</h3>
				<p class="p">Cognitive restructuring is aimed at identifying those thoughts, attitudes and assumptions that create, exacerbate or maintain intense, unhealthy 
					negative emotion such as severe anxiety or panic, shame, guilt, jealousy, envy, intense anger, excessive shyness, and depression. Some of the cognitions or thinking patterns associated with emotional disturbance may be automatic and conscious and thus easily articulated; whilst others may 
					be so well rehearsed that they do not form part of conscious awareness. Once elicited and identified, these beliefs are evaluated in a scientific 
					manner with regards to the following general principles: </p>
				<ul class="p"> 
					<li>Whether they are merely subjective opinions or based on some sort of objective evidence that suggests that they are more like facts than mere 
						opinions. In other words, are they in line with reality?</li>
					<li>Whether they help us to achieve our emotional or practical goals or result in self-defeating emotional and behavioural reactions.</li>
					<li> Whether they follow logical reasoning.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p">Thoughts that (1) do not follow logical reasoning, (2) that represent subjective opinion as oppose to being based on factual evidence and that (3) 
					are likely to lead to excessive emotional arousal or self-destructive behaviour are considered dysfunctional, inaccurate or irrational. It is these sorts 
					of thinking errors or dysfunctional beliefs that are identified and targeted throughout intervention. What we now know is that specific sorts of cognitive errors are associated with specific emotional states and behavioural responses. Well trained CBT therapists would often be able to help their 
					clients quickly identify which clinically relevant beliefs are perpetuating their problem. </p>
				<p class="p"> A variety of different dysfunctional beliefs have been identified and conceptualized as contributing toward various forms of psychological distress. 
					Ellis, Beck and others have proposed somewhat different beliefs and belief systems responsible for psychological disturbance. Beck typically considers cognitive errors to be responsible for emotional distress and Cognitive Therapy tends to focus mainly on the attributions or meanings that 
					individuals make about themselves, others or the world in response to specific situations or stressors. Ellis' REBT model (Ellis & Harper, 1961) 
					proposes that four specific types of beliefs, otherwise known as evaluative beliefs, underly psychological distress. These are further described 
					below</p>
				<p class="p"> 1) Demands, result from our tendency to take healthy preferences or desires and turn them into unrealistic, perfectionistic, rigid and absolute rules 
					and expectations of one's self, others or the world. Demandingness is typically reflected in language which incorporates words such as 'must, ought 
					to, should, have to and need'. A typical demand associated with performance anxiety would be, "I absolutely must do well in that exam and at the 
					very least end up in the top three in my class". <br>
					2) Awfulizing, which reflects an exaggeration of the badness or negative consequences associated with a particular situation or event such that a 
					bad, inconvenient or uncomfortable situation is seen as terrible, horrible or awful. For instance, "It would be terrible if I didn't do well in my exam. 
					It will be the end of my studies and I'll never be able to achieve anything in my life". <br>
					3) Low frustration tolerance (LFT) beliefs typically stem from demands for ease and comfort, and reflect an intolerance of discomfort or frustration. For example,"I would not be able to handle failing that test; I couldn't stand the embarrassment. That, would be intolerable". <br>
					4) Global evaluations of human worth, either of self or others, refer to a set of beliefs that imply that our value and worth can be objectively rated 
					and that some people can be evaluated as objectively worthless (including yourself) or at least less worthy than others. Typically, individuals neglect merely judging their behaviour or performance (which is objectively possible) and end up judging their entire selves instead. For instance, "I 
					would really be a complete failure and a worthless idiot if I were to fail this test. </p>
				<h3 class="h3"> HOW DOES CBT TYPICALLY WORK? </h3>
				<h4 class="h4">ASSESSMENT </h4>
				<p class="p"> Almost all clients present for psychotherapy as a result of some sort of an emotional or behavioural problem that may be affecting their ability to 
					function in some way or another. </p>
				<p class="p">Emotional problems would include examples such as: </p>
				<!-- @EvilSock class= "-" for list -->
				<ul class="-"> 
				<li>depressed mood</li>	
				<li>anxiety</li>	
				<li>intense frustration</li>	
				<li>anger</li>	
				<li>jealousy</li>	
				<li>guilt</li>	
				<li>shame or</li>	
				<li>hurt</li>	
				</ul>

				<p class="p">Behavioural problems that either accompany such emotional problems or occur as primary presenting problems would include examples such as:
				</p>
				<ul class="p">
					<li>procrastination</li>
					<li>substance abuse</li>
					<li>aggression</li>
					<li>avoidant coping</li>
					<li>unassertiveness</li>
					<li>ineffective communication</li>
					<li>trichotillomania (hair pulling)/skin picking or</li>
					<li>tics</li>
					<li>defiance or oppositionality</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p">Even when clients present with a practical problem that they feel they need help with (e.g. domestic abuse, indecision, dealing with difficult 
					people), there is always some sort of emotional or behavioural hurdle that makes it difficult for them to implement a practical solution. </p>
				<p class="p">Any good CBT intervention is based on an initial assessment and understanding of the presenting problem. This is aimed at arriving at a diagnosis 
					and conceptualization upon which treatment is determined. Both psychotherapists and therapy-seeking clients would do well to be patient in ensuring that the primary concern is fully understood before embarking on any sort of intervention. Far too often treatment begins without a thorough 
					conceptualization of the problem. This would typically result from the following factors:
					 </p>

				<ul class="p" > 
					<li> an inadequate assessment process</li>
					<li>inadequate theoretical understanding of the presenting problem (on the part of the therapist),</li>
					<li>vital information being withheld by the client during the assessment phase, or</li>
					<li>impatience in starting with intervention on either the therapist or client's behalf.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="p">Conceptualizing the problem would typically entail the identification of the following factors that may be contributing toward the problem and it's 
					maintenance: </p>
				<ul class="p"> 
					<li>predisposing or historical factors (relevant childhood experience, personality factors, core beliefs, genetic/familial history, pre-existing medical/-
						psychiatric conditions)</li>
					<li>• precipitating factors (recent stressors/events that may have contributed toward the development of the current emotional or behavioural problem)</li>

					<li> perpetuating factors (environmental factors/behaviours/beliefs) that are responsible for the maintenance of the problem.</li>
					<li> protective factors (beliefs, behaviours, strengths and social support) that assist the client in dealing with this problem.</li>
				</ul>
			<p class="p"> Treatment should thus be based on a conceptualization of the problem based on the above-mentioned factors. Treatment strategies essentially 
				target those factors (often maintenance or perpetuating factors) that, if altered, would result in remission of the most pressing emotional and behavioural symptoms.</p>
			<p class="p"> In CBT, certain specific beliefs and behaviours are typically seen as central to the maintenance of emotional and behavioural problems, and a variety of strategies and techniques are utilized in altering such beliefs or perceptions. Altering certain behavioural reactions is often also of central importance. The primary difference between CBT and other psychotherapy approaches is that CBT conceptualizes psychological disturbance in this 
				way, and sees faulty or dysfunctional thinking as central to such disturbance. One of the primary criticisms that CBT has of other therapeutic approaches is that non-CBT approaches typically use models for understanding psychological problems that are based on abstract and unmeasurable 
				concepts and phenomena upon which treatment strategies are based, for which there is often little empirical (scientific) support. Beliefs and behaviours are measurable concepts which can be altered through intervention. There is now ample evidence from research to suggest that if one 
				identifies and targets the correct beliefs and or behavioural patterns associated with such emotional or behavioural disturbance, then intervention 
				is likely to be effective and psychological disturbance likely to diminish.</p>
			<p class="p">The assessment of someone who presents with panic disorder would, for instance focus greatly on identifying the catastrophic misappraisals associated with what they fear may result from their panic, for example "I could have a heart attack" or "I could lose control of myself or go crazy". It 
				would also seek to identify the escape or avoidance behaviours accompanying the individual's anxiety, as well as the use of 'safety' behaviours 
				aimed at preventing anxiety or panic. Such escape or avoidance, or the use of safety behaviours are typically targeted during intervention as a 
				means of disproving one's inaccurate predictions about the threat of panic. The assessment of someone who presents with depression would often 
				focus initially on the most recent and pressing set of circumstances that may have triggered the depressive episode together with the thoughts or beliefs that the individual has about the meaning of these events. Assessment would be aimed at developing a cognitive conceptualization of how 
				these factors interact together. Therapists would also want to assess for avoidant behaviour or withdrawal, which is often based on lethargy and a 
				sense of helplessness and hopelessness. Such behavioural inactivation is considered as a perpetuating factor for depressed mood as it reduces the 
				opportunity for perceived accomplishment or pleasure.
				 </p>
			<h4 class="h4">MOTIVATIONAL ENHANCEMENT AND PSYCHO-EDUCATION </h4>
			<p class="p">With certain emotional (primarily anger) and behavioural problems (procrastination, substance abuse and aggression), time may initially be 
				required for motivational enhancement as clients with such presenting problems are often not sufficiently motivated, prepared or committed to 
				begin immediately with active intervention. Clients with anger problems often blame their anger on the world as oppose to their reactions to it; and 
				individuals with substance abuse or addiction problems often initially present as a result of the pressure of loved ones. Individuals with mood and 
				anxiety disorder symptoms typically need less motivational enhancement as the discomfort of their symptoms is already sufficient to enhance motivation for intervention. Such individuals may, however, require some assistance in preparing for the often difficult but worthwhile challenges that 
				effective treatment will require. For instance, those suffering with anxiety symptoms are often encouraged to 'face their fears' in very specific and 
				structured ways for the sake of disproving them. Individuals with panic disorder are often prepared to get used to the physical sensations that normally trigger panic for the sake of learning that these do not result in any of the catastrophic outcomes that the individual is afraid of. Those with 
				OCD may be encouraged (as a part of prolonged exposure and response prevention) to purposely think the thoughts that they would normally try 
				to suppress or discard. Such intervention strategies are, however, often difficult for clients to engage with, and a fair degree of motivational enhancement is often necessary for clients to appreciate the long-term benefits thereo </p>
			<p class="p"> 
				Psycho-education involves the explanation of the therapist's conceptualization of the problem and an explanation of which factors would need to 
be targeted throughout intervention in order for treatment to be effective and remission to occur. This is an important stage in the treatment process 
as the requirements of treatment become clear and this assists clients to prepare for intervention, in addition to providing the platform for the client 
to discuss his/ her concerns with the therapist who can then assist in allaying fears or further enhancing motivational readiness.
			</p>
			<p class="p">
				Subsequent to diagnosis, conceptualization and the development of a treatment strategy, therapists and their clients should be in a position to discuss the expected length of intervention and exactly what it would entail. Referral for medication to a general practitioner or psychiatrist may be 
indicated depending on the nature and severity of the presenting problem.
			</p>

			<h4 class="h4"> 
				INTERVENTION
			</h4>
			<p class="p">
				Active intervention is usually focussed on reducing distressing emotional states and/or self-defeating behaviour. Most sessions would begin with 
an assessment of the primary clinical problem, be it mood or behaviour, from the preceding week. This would typically be followed by a discussion 
of the therapeutic homework assignment that may have been set for the preceding week. The session is then governed by an agenda set collaboratively by the therapist and client. The majority of the active work throughout the session typically involves a great deal of collaborative and interactive discussion between the therapist and client that is aimed at identifying specific beliefs perceived to underly the primary clinical proble
			</p>
			<p class="p">
				Once identified, these beliefs are usually evaluated for their accuracy and helpfulness or inaccuracy and unhelpfulness. More helpful and functional beliefs are then identified and discussed with respect to their potential in alleviating emotional distress and/or reducing destructive behaviour. 
Therapeutic homework assignments are often aimed at testing out certain inaccurate beliefs or practicing the implementation of new functional 
ways of thinking. Good CBT therapists will not only spend time with their clients developing new, helpful ways of thinking, but will also set specific tasks aimed at helping clients implement such alternative philosophies. CBT is thus as much a "doing therapy" as what it is a "talking therapy". The reality is that "talking" often results in little progress if it isn't simultaneously accompanied by an alternative way of "doing". Therapeutic 
sessions may also involve a considerable degree of discussion about adopting different behavioural reactions that may assist in reducing depressed 
mood, anxiety, hair pulling (in trichotillomania), cravings for illicit substances or managing perpetuating factors in insomnia. Homework assignments may thus also involve the adoption of alternative behavioural reactions
			</p>
			<h3 class="h3" > HOW DOES CBT DEAL WITH "THE PAST" </h3>
			<p class="p"> There is unfortunately this misconception, held mainly by misinformed critics of the approach, that CBT denies the relevance of the past. CBT certainly recognizes that we are strongly influenced by experiences throughout our life and of course our childhood. How we think about ourselves, 
				the world, and the future is strongly influenced by early experience where we learn (often in a biased and context specific way) about who we are, 
				how others will treat us, how to deal with interpersonal situations and how the world works. CBT suggests that the influence of the past is only 
				problematic because the influence of past experience operates in the present in the form of beliefs that we carry with us in today's world, and which 
				we may well have rehearsed and internalized over many years. In CBT, what happened a second ago with regards to our thinking, is just as important as what happened to us 30 years ago. The past is thus seen as exerting its influence in the "here and now" by the way in which our current day 
				thinking is affected by it. We cannot change the past, but we can change the way we let the past influence us in today's world, by addressing our 
				thinking in the "here and now". CBT therapists would often be interested in relevant early experience during the assessment phase, but would typically not spend a great deal of time in discussing such experience during active treatment unless there are specific beliefs that would require a specific focus on past events in order for such beliefs to be restructured.
			</p>
			<h3 class="h3"> ACCEPTING NEGATIVE EMOTION </h3>
			<p class="p"> CBT recognizes that emotion is an integral and inescapable aspect of human experience. Emotion is what brings meaning to our lives, enriches experience and memory, enables learning and protects us from harm. Positive emotional states like joy, excitement, relaxation, happiness and euphoria are what most of us strive for much of the time. The reality is that these emotions are typically short-lived and unsustainable. Healthy negative 
				emotional states such as sadness, apprehension, frustration, regret, boredom and disappointment are uncomfortable but essentially normal and actually motivate us to alter undesirable situations. Unhealthy emotional states such as depression, anxiety, rage, intense jealousy, hurt and guilt are 
				often excessively intense and enduring and tend to impact negatively on behaviour and one's ability to deal with adversity. It is these emotional 
				states that require attention, which is the target of CBT.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				It is however recognised that depressed mood may well be normal under certain circumstances, such as in the case of bereavement. CBT therapists 
				would not target intense emotion that is perceived as appropriate but may well target the irrational beliefs that individuals have, that may lead to 
				unhealthily avoidant ways of coping with such an emotion. For example, those struggling to allow themselves to grieve the loss of a loved one 
				may be avoiding such emotion as a result of misperceptions such as "feeling depressed and being tearful means that I'm a weak person and that I 
				will crumble if I allow myself to feel this way". The goal of CBT is thus to assist individuals in reducing excessively intense emotional states (e.g. 
				depression/anger) that are disabling, and replace these with an emotional experience that is more manageable, less disabling and associated with 
				more appropriate behavioural activation (e.g. sadness/disappointment/frustration).
			 </p>
			 <h3 class="h3"> HOW TO FIND A CBT THERAPIST </h3>
			 <p class="p">
				There are unfortunately very few CBT therapists in South Africa. A study by Möller and van Tonder (1999) suggested that only about 6% of South 
				African clinical psychologists could be regarded as cognitive behaviour therapists. As of the time of this study, only 20% of clinical psychologists 
				had had any training in CBT, only 5% used CBT more than 50% of the time, and only 4% regularly consulted CBT journals or literature.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p"> 
				As of 2011, no formal minimum training standards are provided for CBT therapists in South Africa and there is no formal national CBT organization or training standards committee. It may thus be most helpful to consider psychotherapists as belonging to 1 of 4 categories with respect to their 
				proficiency and experience in using CBT: <br>
				(1) No experience or interest in the use of CBT as a therapeutic model.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				(2) Some interest in and experience with the use of CBT
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				(3) Primarily uses CBT as a therapeutic approach and has significant experience in using CBT, has attended international conferences and workshops in CBT but does not have any specific international certification as a CBT therapist.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				(4) Internationally certified CBT therapists, with specific qualifications based on supervised practice by an international training standards committee.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				It is most probably wise, when seeking a therapist who provides CBT to try and assess which of the above-mentioned categories they may fall into. 
				Many therapists will report that they use CBT, but few have actually had specific supervised training in the model and many do not provide cutting 
				edge treatments for specific disorders. In addition, it would also be important to check whether or not the therapist has specific experience in your 
				area of concern. For instance, an individual may have plenty of experience in working with anxiety or depression, but little experience or expertise 
				in treating tic disorders, insomnia or psychosis, for example. Below is a list of reasonable questions that one could ask a therapist prior to making 
				an appointment or during an initial appointment aimed at assessing their experience with CBT.

			 <h4 class="h4"> 
				QUESTIONS FOR DETERMINING A THERAPIST'S LEVEL OF EXPERTISE WITH CBT
			 </h4>
			 <p class="p">
				Have you received any training in CBT? <br>
				Training could vary from an introduction during a Masters-program to an internationally certified qualification.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				Did your training include individual supervision of case material from an experienced or internationally certified CBT therapist? <b></b>
				It is important to distinguish between theoretical training and practical supervised training that includes individual supervision in the use of CBT 
				in working with clients.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				Does your CBT training include international certification from an international training standards committee? <br>
				Typical international certification is from the Beck Institute or the Albert Ellis Institute. Other training centres in the USA and the UK also exist.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				How many years experience do you have in practising CBT? <br>
				We all start with little experience and build our knowledge base. It would be wise not to doubt a well trained and supervised CBT therapist with 1 
				or 2 years experience. It however goes without saying that those therapists with greater practical experience, bring the expertise accumulated from 
				this experience to helping you.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				In what way do you use CBT in your practice? <br>
				Many people will tell you that they integrate CBT into their practice. This typically would entail using skills or techniques from more than one theoretical orientation at the same time. This approach is known as eclecticism. This is not unethical nor an unacceptable practice. Should you look 
				for a CBT therapist specifically, this is obviously not the type of service provided by a therapist with an eclectic approach. Therapist will also tell 
				you that they use different theoretical approaches to treat different clients and problems. This is also an acceptable approach, it would however be 
				important to determine if the therapist is sufficiently trained in CBT and if the therapist would suggest CBT for your specific problem.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				Ask if the therapist has training in the CBT treatment of your specific disorder. <br>
				It important to know that the therapist has disorder specific training in the condition that you require help with.
			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				Ask the CBT therapist to explain the specific treatment to be employed to treat your specific condition. <br>
				Inform yourself via recognised CBT websites about the newest treatments available and the researchers responsible for the development of this 
				treatment. You will find a list of helpful links to international CBT training and research facilities on our website (www.cognitive-behavioural-therapy.co.za).

			 <h3 class="h3" > MODERN-DAY CBT TREATMENT OPTIONS</h3>
			 <p class="p">
				The theoretical contributions of the cognitive theorists (Beck, Ellis etc.), together with the initial contributions of the behavioural theorists (Pavlov, 
				Skinner, Wolpe etc.) provided for the foundation of modern-day CBT theory and practice. Modern-day CBT-based treatments for emotional and 
				behavioural disorders are however, continually being altered and revised. These revisions are the product of what we are continually learning from 
				research about which factors are primarily responsible for the onset and maintenance of psychological disorders. The recommended treatment 
				guidelines for CBT-based interventions with anxiety disorders, depression, borderline personality disorder, insomnia, anger, substance use disorders, habit disorders and schizophrenia have changed substantially over the last twenty and even the last ten years. For instance, we now know that 
				using controlled breathing and relaxation training as a primary intervention strategy for panic disorder is not the most useful way of tackling this 
				highly treatable condition and may even reduce long-term prognosis. We also now know that trying to reduce, suppress or remove negative 
				thoughts is less helpful than what we once thought when working with individuals with depression. We know that how individuals react to their 
				negative thoughts and emotions is of greater importance than whether or not they have negative thoughts or emotions in the context of anxiety or 
				depression, for example. There have been a number of more recent theoretical models that have gained momentum over the course of the last 
				decade, many of which are considered as part of "the third wave" movement within the CBT tradition. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), 
				Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) would be typical examples thereof. Each of these "newer" 
				models within the CBT tradition emphasize the notion of non-judgmental acceptance, awareness of and mindfulness toward negative thoughts and 
				emotional states as a means of reacting in a more functional manner toward these states. The concept of mindfulness is regularly cited within modern-day CBT treatment models and is often a significant treatment component that is introduced earlier on in treatment but is not considered a 
				means of treatment itself, in isolation. Mindfulness is typically used as a means of emotional regulation and in reducing emotionally driven behaviours that perpetuate emotional disturbance.

			 </p>
			 <p class="p">
				The table below provides a short summary of the most prominent treatment components associated with modern-day CBT. These core treatment 
				components would typically be accompanied by standard treatment components such as psychoeducation, motivational enhancement and relapse 
				prevention.
